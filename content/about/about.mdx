# Court Booking System

In 2023, I rebuilt the Court Booking System from scratch using [Next.js 13](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs) and [React 18](https://react.dev/) along with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). This is a [Spring MVC](https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/) application which was written in Java, had become obsolete due to deprecated dependencies. The system, which was originally developed by my team as our final project for graduation, is a web application designed for a fitness center that offers courts available for booking. It enables fitness center members to effortlessly schedule and reserve available courts in advance, simplifying the process of planning and organizing their activities.

## Features

The system includes the following features:

- **Court Availability:** Members can view the availability of each court in real-time and choose a time slot that fits their schedule.
- **Booking:** Members can reserve and book available courts for a specific date and time.
- **Cancellation:** Members can cancel their bookings if they no longer need the court, freeing up the time slot for other members to use.
- **Notification:** Members receive a confirmation email upon booking and a reminder email before their scheduled court time.

## Scope

This version of the Court Booking System has a limited scope, as it is designed to be a starting point for the fitness center to build upon. Future versions of the system may include additional features, such as payment processing, court-specific information (e.g., size, type, etc.), and integration with other fitness center systems.
